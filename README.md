# Node Chat

A basic chat app built using Node.js and socket.io.

## Features
* Each new tab or window that points to the same URL opens a new client
* Any message sent from one client is sent to all clients
* Form styling using [Materialize](http://materializecss.com)

## TODO
* Display missed messages when new client is opened
* Add "bubble" styling to messages
